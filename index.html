<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p class="message">Hi there! My name is Christopher Ko. It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<p>
  I am a third-year undergraduate student at <a href="http://queensu.ca">Queen's University</a>
  completing a bachelors degree in <a href ="http://mast.queensu.ca/meng/">Mathematics and Engineering</a>
  with a specialization in Computing and Communications. This degree combines computer engineering
  with high level mathematics. I spent the summer of 2015 working at Canada Post on the Process Engineering team.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I have strong interests with software development, and data science.
</p>

<h3>Courses</h3>
  I am currently completing courses with the department of computer engineering and the department
  of mathematics. A list of courses that I've completed can be found <a href="{{site.url}}/courses.html">here</a>.

  <h3>Projects</h3>
  Most of my projects that I have worked on can be found on my
