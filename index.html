<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p class="message">Hi there! My name is Christopher Ko. It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<p>
  I am a third-year undergraduate student at <a href="http://queensu.ca">Queen's University</a> completing a Bachelor's degree in <a href ="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/meng/">Mathematics and Engineering</a> with a specialization in <a href="http://www.mast.queensu.ca/meng/undergrad/options.php"> Computing and Communications</a>. I am currently completing a 16-month professional internship as an application developer at <a href="http://www.celestica.com">Celestica</a> in Toronto, Canada.

  <!-- Most recently, I spent the summer of 2015 working at <a href="http://canadapost.ca">Canada Post</a> on the Process Engineering team, and I am currently working as an IT Support Staff team member at the <a href="http://myams.org">Alma Mater Society</a> of Queen's University. -->

  Currently, I have strong interests with software development, and data science.

  I am also looking for summer opportunities starting May 2016, or 12 - 16 month internship opportunities starting May 2016. -->
