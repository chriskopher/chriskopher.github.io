  Mathematics. Engineering. Web Development. Data Analytics.
</p>

I am a Queen's University Mathematics and Engineering student specializing in Computing and Communications. My program is a cross-disciplinary degree that combines higher level theoretical and applied math with a strong foundation in computer engineering. While the degree has a focus on technical skills and mathematical modelling, it emphasizes engineering communications through report writing and presentation preparation.

I am looking to apply my unique combination of skills to pursue new and exciting opportunities.
