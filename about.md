<p class="message">
  Here's a little bit of my background.
</p>

I am a [Queen's University Mathematics and Engineering](http://www.mast.queensu.ca/meng/undergrad/info.php) student specializing in Computing and Communications. My program is a cross-disciplinary degree that combines higher level theoretical and applied math with a strong foundation in computer engineering. While the degree has a focus on technical skills and mathematical modelling, it emphasizes engineering communications through report writing and presentation preparation.

I am looking to apply my unique combination of skills to pursue new and exciting opportunities.
