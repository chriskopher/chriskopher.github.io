Working under the Engineering Society of Queen's University as an IT Manager, I have been tasked with creating an new online branding website for the well-known campus pub.

It is currently a work in progress as I'm learning the ropes of basic web development, but I am confident that I will be able to create a clean, responsive website that will meet the client's needs.
