[My first project](http://chriskopher.github.io) is building this website hosted on Github Pages. It is based on Jekyll and Bootstrap.

It is currently a work in progress and will be updated frequently during the build process.

### Completed Tasks:
* Multiple pages and project posts
* Integrate a start and end date to the project subtitle
* Created a tagging system to sort posts by projects or volunteer
