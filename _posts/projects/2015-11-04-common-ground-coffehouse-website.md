Working under the Alma Mater Society at Queen's University as a IT support staff, I have been tasked with the creation of a new online website for the well-known student-run coffee shop.

It is currently a work in progress as I'm learning the ropes of basic web development, but I am confident that I will be able to create a clean, responsive website that will meet the client's needs.

Technologies: WordPress, HTML, CSS, PHP, (minor) JavaScript
