At [Hack Western II](https://hackwestern.com/hw2/), a team of myself and 3 others joined to create a website that would link a user (who only wants to eat a slice or two of pizza), with someone else in order to split a pizza. The website was built with [Parse](http://parse.com), Bootstrap, and jQuery.

Note: Parse has now been deprecated by Facebook.

Link: [findpizzafor.me](http://findpizzafor.me).
