The completed algorithm was a collaboration with other Queen's students for our APSC 200 (Engineering Design and Practice II) course. We were tasked to solve a problem involving multi-agent systems, and we aimed to optimize package delivery given local-only information. In addition to the creation of the algorithm, an engineering report was written discussing many factors of the implementation. Contact me if you'd like a copy.

Here's the description from the repo:

<p class="message">
The P2 Project for APSC 200, Section 203-03. <br>
<br>
This project defines an algorithm that calculates an optimized path between two graph nodes using only LOCAL information. That is, it is different from algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm in the sense that it does not have full view of the graph, and cannot run multiple possible paths before deciding.
<br><br>
The algorithm is being used to optimize package delivery paths. It is being tested using the 10 largest cities in California by population, and will run in MATLAB.
