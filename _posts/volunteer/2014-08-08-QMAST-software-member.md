I am a member of the [Queen's Mostly Autonomous Sailboat Team (QMAST)](http://qmast.ca). We are a design team that competes in the [International Robotic Sailing Regatta](http://sailbot.org) after having designed a _mostly_ autonomous sailboat. The team is composed of Mechanical, Electrical, and Software teams.

As a member of the software team, I have assisted a computer and software engineering team in the design, implementation, and optimization of an autonomous sailboat algorithm.

In my time with the team, I have worked with the sailboat's Arduino Mega/Uno and Raspberry Pi circuit boards that are used to run the software.

My role specifically includes optimizing and ensuring the reliability of the radio controller used to communicate with the sailboat. Additionally, I have been providing support to other software project teams as needed (AIRMAR, Computer Vision, Autosail).
