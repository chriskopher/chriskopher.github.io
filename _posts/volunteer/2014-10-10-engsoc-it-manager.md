I am a member of the Queen's University Engineering Society (EngSoc) working as one of the IT managers.

As an IT manager, I work with a committee to improve the Engineering Society's technological infrastructure.

My role includes designing and implementing websites for various EngSoc clubs and committees using WordPress and a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The projects I've worked on will also appear on my [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects.html) page.
